			ID.innerHTML = `I swear this place is so God damned spiteful. It’s like the whole of society is after my well-being, and I can’t do anything but avert my gaze as the eyes bore into my scalp. If I look at them they might recognize my disdain as something they can exploit for their own nefarious means. <br> <br>

			Their god does nothing while His subjects torment and kill their brothers and sisters. Brave knights from their keeps battle for a victory worth naught more than the hair off of my scrotum. But through the bloody mist I can see that there are in fact no winners. The only thing that is being won is the honor of losing.<br> <br>
			
			These ‘people’ as they call themselves have built such a deranged word view. A view which sees the free man is not truly free but is confined to the limits of ‘society’. I see them as livestock and would treat them accordingly, alas that is frowned upon. Though I cannot be deterred.<br> <br>
			
			The eye is always watching. No matter where I may hide, the golden eye and its tears of silver always see me. For half of the cycle the golden eye weeps before my shadow, and the latter half contains the mercury diadem which feigns innocence. But I know that it is a reflection of the golden eye’s gaze.<br> <br>
			
			Benedict speaks to me in the form of a crimson Forest of ivory trees and the boulder of flesh. He demands crimson to feed his avarice. I don’t have enough crimson within my body to feed him however, so I must search for it. It can be harvested from only the ripest of crimson vessels. I can find them by their lonesome in the absence of the eye’s malice. Benedict provides me with my sacrificial ordinance in the form of Angela’s pike, which gives me the power to slay fruit of crimson
			
			Though the world says I am an animal I don’t see it that way. I am above all those who cannot join me on my plain of heightened sanity. I am capable of seeing past their misguided veils and echoing chambers of spit and phlegm. I am truly human and experience earth like only the pure can. <br> <br>
			
			But recently Benedict has demanded more crimson. On my now more frequent harvests my ventures have gone noticed by the uncommon passerby when the crimson fruit has been slew. They never comprehend my actions as anything more intelligent than those of a bear, if only they could see what I see. They haven’t the guidance of the Benediction of The Crimson Swamp to sway their thoughts and actions.
			
			By the unfortunate stroke of Azur grace my actions went noticed by many a vessel. The problem I was posed with had two outcomes: succumb to the hammer Throne of Azur Retribution, or provide the Benediction with a flowing bounty of crimson. Of course I decided upon the latter, being the enlightened and true human that I am.<br> <br>
			
			I was brought into this rotting golden expanse from the hottest point in space time within the mass of the earth. From the molten core I burst in a bubble of flesh and slime. After being carried for many cycles in the belly of the Mimmelian Beast which combs the mane of the core. I was excreted in this specific timeline and point in time and space to discover the Benediction and cleanse the planet of its failed growths.
			
			The vessels which mocked me in my fetal days now stare with fiery force into my very psyche and wish to corrupt my inner me. But I will contest their spiteful stares by providing them no stimuli. <br> <br>
			
			Alas I am placed before the Throne of Azur Retribution and must face trial for my faith to the mighty Benediction of The Crimson Swamp and it’s cage of ivory arches. The Lord of Past Penance speaks directly to my inner man, the one hiding within my brain. It says I will face mortal bounds due to my trust in my faith. I will resist all attempts to alienate me from my ideals. <br> <br>
			
			I now find myself on the carpet of Azur headed to the sepulcher of repentance. My beloved Benediction will be unable to free me from this trap and I fear, for the first time in my life, the edge of a cliff. I have braved skies of flame and wind, and gave Benedict nearly enough crimson to initiate my rite of passage to the next phase. But at this moment as the clasps tighten around my soul I feel scared. But my purpose here is clearly at its end, and as I leave this timeline there will surely be another true human to take my place.

The horns blare loud with the song of arrival. Bittersweet is the melody, and silent is the air around, save for the trumpets. <br><br>

“Yet another comes to this land. I hope he is here by good terms,” a man says to his counterpart.<br>
“Wish we must, for the unwilling cause me much grief.” He replies.<br>
They nod in agreement, waiting for the new one to inevitably come their way.
<br><br>
“Greetings, sir.” It says to me; a voice, detached, close, yet far. It echoes inside my mind as if the men and women around me cannot hear. Their faces are plastered with a dull look, a look of complacency and sorrow. 
<br><br>
“Who are you all?” I ask the mass.<br>
“We abide beside our gods for all eternity here in Dayus.” A group of men step up to say together, with an elderly man at the forefront.<br>
“Dayus you say?” I ask<br>
“Dayus indeed.” A young woman, not older than twenty, says to me with unfounded glee.<br>
“I am dead?” I ask, a rhetorical question, as the obvious answer is yes. Dayus harbors only the dead and those who yet live.<br>
“What is your name?” The old man inquires.<br>
“My name is… I mean my name is…” I stop. I am unable to recall. My name slips my mind. The very thing that makes me who I am is no longer mine. <br>
“I cannot remember my name.” I say, bewildered at my loss of recollection. <br>
“Perhaps we shall call you Oan.” A middle aged man says.<br>
My eyes reflect a glassy sheen, I utter not a sound. I sit on the creamy white grass, as soft as silk, and fluffy like wool. It is soothing like a mother’s caress, too caring.
<br><br>
I stand upon my two feet, at least I am still human in this way. I walk away from where I arrived, quietly through the gathering. It is only when I get through the gaggle that I understand my situation. 
“Dead.” I shiver at the thought. not the thought anymore, but the reality. My nightmare is my reality. Here I stand in the plain of Dayus, the birthplace of divines, and the resting place of mortals.
<br><br>
The roads lead nowhere but back. Dayus is an endless expanse that infinitely loops unto itself. Thousands, millions sit and stand and mingle about in the grass, now green instead of white.
<br><br>
But beyond them all stands a great gate of silver and limestone. My attention is quickly drawn to it. The way it sits so elegantly on the horizon is as appealing as the call of a lover. I go to it.
<br><br>
“The gates are forbidden.” The voice fills my head once again. I am caught off guard as I had already forgotten of its existence. <br>
“Why?” I ask, unsure if I should expect a response or not.<br>
“It is dangerous.” <br>
“I don’t understand. What is dangerous about a door? Might it fall upon me as I approach?” I muse the voice.<br>
“May I ask you a question?” It asks.<br>
“If it is easy to answer, you may.” I respond.<br>
“Very well. My question is, who are you?” The easiest question to answer, But not now. Now it is the hardest question. I stop in my tracks. The wind kisses my eyes with her cold lips. Tears find their easy way down my face, cold as ice.<br>
“I do not know… who I am.” I admit to the voice. I feel defeated. My emotions have jumped from atop a mountain to the deepest of trenches, and back to the surface only to slip and fall back down beneath. <br>
“Why don’t I know who I am?” I plead to the voice. Yet it does not respond.
<br><br>
“Greetings, sir.” A man and his friend say to me as I somberly pass them by.<br>
“I do not wish to speak.” I say with a sigh.<br>
“What exactly troubles you, sir?” The shorter of the two asks.<br>
“I do not remember who I am,” I say, “do you know who you are?” <br>
He takes a glance at his partner and responds, “I am Yale, and my friend is called Herald.” <br>
I am taken aback by this. Why is it that these two men know their names yet I am not allowed my own? Is Dayus truly this unfair?<br>
“How do you know?”<br>
“We do not know our true names, friend.” The taller and younger man says. “But we can create for ourselves a new identity here in Dayus.” <br>
“What is your name here?” The older man asks me.<br>
“How can I just choose my own name? I don’t even know what I am like.” I complain.<br>
“You know plenty. You have dark skin, straight brown hair, a fair and clean complexion. Your clothes are modest and simple, and your voice is smooth and high in pitch. That is who you are in Dayus.” The man called Yale tells me, “we shall part for now, and until we meet once more, consider a name for yourself, friend. Goodbye.” The two wave at me and walk off together into the far away grasses, hands in a loving embrace
<br><br>
As I attempt to approach the gate I mull over what the two men told me. All are without name in Dayus. I am to create my own name, my own unique title. But based on what? Nothing more than my physical appearance. I have no character to base my name off of. 
<br><br>
“Ma’am I have a favor to ask.” I say to a middle aged woman whom I cross paths with.<br>
“What is it, sir?” She replies.<br>
“I need a name. I want you to give me a name.” I beg her, “I don’t know how. I have only just arrived here. I have nothing.”<br>
“My friend you need not to fret. I will give you something. your name will be Lenin.”<br>
“Thank you, ma’am. I am now Lenin.” I say as I shake her hand, gratitude rushing through it. 
<br><br>
I wave goodbye to her, such a kind woman. I now have the one thing that makes me who I am. But even still I yearn to know what that fantastical hate may harbor behind its doors.
<br><br>
Then as if it could read my thoughts, the voice returned once more. “Behind the doors is the one thing that is forbidden in Dayus.” It bellows in my head.<br>
“What is it? Mayhaps it is eternal pleasure? Is it untold riches? Is it a great banquet? Power? Pride?” I berate the voice with questions. <br>
“It is what you desire, but at the price of eternal duty.”<br>
“What do you mean?” <br>
It is gone once again. Leaving me with more questions than answers. Now I can only wonder what it is that speaks to me. Is it a god? But I worship no god. Is it a ruler? But Dayus has no ruler. 
<br><br>
I most desire knowledge of me. But I do not want to upset the voice or the people around me so I shall block out my wishes and backtrack to where the other’s abide.
<br><br>
Dayus brings me joy unending. Friends, wine, love, and sex. “The luxury that is death suits us all too well, my friends!” I yell as we sing and dance to Melodies unheard by any but us. <br>
“Death is indeed a blessing! But in death we must remember life!” My friend yells back.<br>
“But we do not know of our lives!” I say to him.<br>
“Indeed, but we can pay homage to the fact that we all once lived.” He says to me.<br>
“How can we be certain?” I say to him.<br>
“Why wouldn’t we be? This is Dayus after all!” He yells as he disappears into the frenzy.
<br><br>
I slow down, my bottle I set on the grass, brown and crunchy. I look down at the horizon, and no matter where my gaze begins it ends at the gates. Long has it been since I last laid eyes on its gleaming arches. As my mind filters the sounds of happiness I can only see that the grass around the gate is white and silky like it was when I arrived. However long ago that was. I begin to sift myself through the crowd as sand sifts through an hourglass. The path beneath my feet is glowing, and it is as if the gate is begging me to reach it.
<br><br>
“Oh my! It’s you. Herald it is the man we met that while ago.” Yale says to his partner as he points at me.<br>
“Indeed, there he stands.” Herald says<br>
As they draw closer I know what they will inquire upon. <br>
“Nice to see you again, sirs.” I tell them as I slow my pace to stand face to face with them. <br>
“You too, my friend. Say, what have you chosen to be your name here?” Yale asks me, as expected.<br>
“My name is Lenin. But I have complaints.” <br>
“Whatever about?” Herald asks <br>
“How is it that we can be sure we ever lived. We do not know anything about ourselves here, so we cannot know how we were in life, thus how can we know we are now in death?”<br>
The two show visible concern on their faces. <br>
“Lenin you mustn’t worry yourself with such thoughts as those. It is true we cannot know for a fact, but just because you do not know yourself yet does not mean you should live here as if you are not truly living. Live and love and your character will reveal itself. Trust.” Yale says with kindness and sympathy in his smile. He too has thought as I do now. I am sure of it.<br>
“I thank you, Yale.” I say as I move along down the grass. 
<br><br>
Though I still harbor doubt I do feel uplifted. But through the updraft the gravity of all the thoughts on my mind weighs me down still. Perhaps I know I am real because I can touch my own skin, but a shell is not the constitution of a human. I am the sum of my life, but if no life has been lived can I truly be human? I have knowledge and strength and I can think freely but who am I? Am I Lenin? Am I Oan? Can I be someone? No, I can be anyone. I am just a blank canvas in need of paint. But my other side says that I am nothing but a useless rag without my colors. 
<br><br>
I have figured out what it is I desire the most. I desire to know who it is I really am and who I was before my supposed passing in the mortal plain. 
<br><br>
Closer and closer I stride, leaving the festivities and friends far behind me. Atop the hill stands the beautiful pillars and the gleaming white gate. They say the gate is locked until the end of time. They say that it causes nothing but sorrow. However I do not care what my fate may be. I am not who I believe I am, and I must shed the veil over my true nature.
<br><br>
“You mustn’t open the gates.” The voice says to me.<br>
“Who are you to give me orders? I obey no master and I pray to no god. You are a fool!” I cry to the voice in my head.<br>
“You are correct. Do as you see fit, sir. The doors will welcome a new life.” It says as it echoes off into silence.<br>
<br><br>
The doors loom over me now. They are a daunting structure, and I wonder if I can open them with the minute strength I possess. 
<br><br>
I recall what someone unknown told me in my short while here, “we are born anew in Dayus.” In my honesty I must confess I did not take that into consideration. I did not think of Dayus as a land one is to be born into. I merely think of it as a parallel, a continuation of our finished mortal lives. Perhaps that misconstrued notion was the catalyst of my unwillingness to believe I am real here. That little chirp in the back of my head is soon drowned out by anxiety and awe as I stand before this massive and imposing structure of intricate design and architecture.
<br><br>
I reach out my hand and as my palms touch the silver it is cold and dry. Although the air is warm the metal is cold as ice. I push on either side and the door inches open. Freezing gust exits the opening and blasts my face. Then the doors begin to open wider on their own, and before I know it they are wide and gaping. 
<br><br>
Before me is a black hole. Voidlike tendrils writhe and scream, in search of something to grab. I am starstruck by the horrendous sight. This flurry of disembodied black hands makes me feel nauseous and weak. I do not move, as I am bound in place, facing the blizzard of tar and wrath. One of the hands catches my shoulder and yanks me off my feet and into the belly of the beast. It is a subzero whirlpool of wraiths and spectors spinning me around eternally.
<br><br>
“Lo! The hope of forbidden knowledge has brought you here. Today you stand before the peaks of Mortus. You shall walk these treacherous passes until the end of your time. Come mental anguish, or mortal injury, you shall never cease movement. You are to carry this stone on your shoulders to the opposite end of my realm, and when you arrive you are to return it to me where I will grant you your next task.”
<br><br>
Instantly my knees are weak under the crushing weight of this boulder. My mind is swarmed by something hot and violent. My memories are flashing in front of my eyes and cause my legs to falter and give out. I am crushed by the stone. 
<br><br>
My eyes open and I am returned to my starting place. Unfinished recollections of experiences long since forgotten plague me still. My feet labor onwards over the first mount and I am reminded of my father. In the trough I am reminded of my mother. My feet are gnashed by the stone as I recall a man of no name. 
<br><br>
Silence is not a luxury I am permitted here. Constant screams and overlapping speech deafens my ears and drowns out my thoughts. 
<br><br>
The path is rocky and uneven. Under this weight I feel my bones splinter and break. The stone falls upon my back once more, and I have arrived back at the beginning where I shall do no more wrong and where I shall be seen serving out my greed until one day I may be freed.
